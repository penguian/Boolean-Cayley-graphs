\begin{abstract}
Bent Boolean functions are fascinating and useful combinatorial objects, whose applications include
coding theory and cryptography. The number of bent functions explodes with dimension, and various
concepts of equivalence are used to classify them. In 1999 Bernasconi and Codenotti [1] noted that the
Cayley graph of a bent function is strongly regular. This talk describes the concept of extended
Cayley equivalence of bent functions, discusses some connections between bent functions, designs,
and codes, and explores the relationship between extended Cayley equivalence and extended affine
equivalence. SageMath scripts and SageMathCloud worksheets [2] are used to compute and display some
of these relationships, for bent functions up to dimension 8.
