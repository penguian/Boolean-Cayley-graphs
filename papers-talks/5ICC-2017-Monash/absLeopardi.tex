\title Yet another database of strongly regular graphs

\text
The Cayley graphs of bent Boolean functions are strongly regular graphs [Bernasconi and Codenotti, 1999].
Programs and libraries such as Nauty and Bliss have made it possible to classify
large numbers of such strongly regular Cayley graphs by graph isomorphism.

This talk describes work in progress to produce and publish a ``big'' database of
strongly regular Cayley graphs of bent Boolean functions in up to 8 dimensions.
