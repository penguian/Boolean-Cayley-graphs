# Boolean-Cayley-graphs
Investigations of Boolean functions, their Cayley graphs, and associated structures.

This project originally began with the idea of refactoring the [bent-functions-duals-Cayley-graphs-public.sagews](https://cloud.sagemath.com/projects/80f4c9e7-8a37-4f59-82e7-aa179ec0b652/files/public/bent-functions-duals-Cayley-graphs-public.sagews)
worksheet, because it is too long, poorly structured, and takes so long to run that CoCalc cannot run it successfully.

The project enables the experimental mathematics that underpins my recent and ongoing investigation into the classification of bent functions by their Cayley graphs.

   Describes how the pattern of commuting and anticommuting pairs of basis elements of a real Clifford algebra, and their representation theory, can be used in the construction of Hadamard matrices.

   Examines a pair of bent functions on and their relationship to a necessary condition for the existence of an automorphism of an edge-coloured graph, whose colours are defined by the properties of a canonical basis for the real representation of a real Clifford algebra.

   Uses a theorem of Radon to prove that the corresponding graphs in the two sequences of strongly regular graphs considered in [1] and [2] are not isomorphic, except in the first 3 cases.

   Explores the connections between bent functions and their Cayley graphs, as well as projective two-weight linear codes, and symmetric designs with the symmetric difference property, through various equivalence classes. Includes exhaustive classifications of bent functions up to 8 dimensions and degree 3, with selected examples of degree 4
