# Boolean-Cayley-graphs
Investigations of Boolean functions, their Cayley graphs, and associated structures.

This project originally began with the idea of refactoring the [bent-functions-duals-Cayley-graphs-public.sagews](https://cloud.sagemath.com/projects/80f4c9e7-8a37-4f59-82e7-aa179ec0b652/files/public/bent-functions-duals-Cayley-graphs-public.sagews)
worksheet, because it is too long, poorly structured, and takes so long to run that SageMathCloud cannot run it successfully.

Both the SageMathCloud project and the current project enable the experimental mathematics that underpins my recent
and ongoing investigation into the classification of bent functions by their Cayley graphs.

Describes how the pattern of commuting and anticommuting pairs of basis elements of a real Clifford algebra, and their representation theory, can be used in the construction of Hadamard matrices.

Examines a pair of bent functions on and their relationship to a necessary condition for the existence of an automorphism of an edge-coloured graph, whose colours are defined by the properties of a canonical basis for the real representation of a real Clifford algebra.

Uses a theorem of Radon to prove that the corresponding graphs in the two sequences of strongly regular graphs considered in [1] and [2] are not isomorphic, except in the first 3 cases.
