# Boolean-Cayley-graphs
Investigations of Boolean functions, their Cayley graphs, and associated structures.

This project originally began with the idea of refactoring the [bent-functions-duals-Cayley-graphs-public.sagews]
(https://cloud.sagemath.com/projects/80f4c9e7-8a37-4f59-82e7-aa179ec0b652/files/public/bent-functions-duals-Cayley-graphs-public.sagews)
worksheet, because it is too long, poorly structured, and takes so long to run that SageMathCloud cannot run it successfully.
